# What is versioning?

- Versioning in Node.js involves managing Node.js itself and the dependencies of applications.
  
- When specifying dependencies in a `package.json` file, we use symbols like `~` and `^` to define version ranges.

- For example:
  - Using `~` (`~4.18.3`): Fix the major and minor versions to `4` and `18`, but allow minor updates (e.g., bug fixes).
  - Using `^` (`^4.18.3`): Fix the major version to `4` and allow minor and patch updates, but be cautious with major releases.

- Major releases (e.g., `4`): They require careful consideration before upgrading, especially for existing applications built on previous major versions.

- Minor releases (e.g., `18`): They often contain recommended bug fixes and security updates, and it's advisable to update to the latest minor version within the same major version.

- Patch releases (e.g., `3`): These are minor fixes and optional updates that can be applied if necessary.

- It's generally recommended to use the `^` symbol when specifying dependencies to allow for minor and patch updates while ensuring compatibility with future versions.
